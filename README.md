Fae Bikes: Swiggy Clone UI
Overview
This project is a UI clone of the popular food delivery app Swiggy. It includes screens mimicking the login process, the main home screen, a food section, and an Instamart section. The purpose of this project is to showcase UI design skills using React Native.

Screens
1. Login Screen
The login screen allows users to authenticate using their phone number and OTP. It provides a seamless login experience to access the app's features.

2. Main Swiggy Home Screen
This screen serves as the main hub of the application. It features non-scrollable CTAs (Call to Action) positioned strategically for easy access to key functionalities.

3. Food Screen
The food screen presents a scrollable list of food options, allowing users to explore various restaurants and select their desired items.

4. Instamart Screen
Similar to the food screen, the Instamart screen showcases groceries and essentials. Users can browse through different categories and make purchases as needed.
